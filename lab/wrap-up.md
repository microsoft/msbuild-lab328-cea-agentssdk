# Wrap-Up

🎉 Congratulations! You've just built your first Custom Engine Agent using the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK and Azure AI Foundry!

In this lab, you learned how to:
* Configure an AI agent in Azure AI Foundry using the Agent Playground
* Upload enterprise documents to ground your agent’s responses
* Scaffold a bot using the M365 Agents SDK in Visual Studio
* Add Semantic Kernel and connect to Azure AI Agent Service
* Integrate your bot with the Azure AI Foundry agent for real-time, grounded reasoning
* Deploy and test your agent in **Microsoft Teams** and **Copilot Chat**



## Next Steps

* Customize your agent’s tone, instructions, or capabilities
* Experiment with different domains, documents, or even multi-agent designs
* Fork the starter repo and keep building 👉 [Lab 328 - Build custom engine agents using Microsoft 365 Agents SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild-lab328-cea-agentssdk)
